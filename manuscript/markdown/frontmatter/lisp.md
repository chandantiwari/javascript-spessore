## Taking a page out of LiSP

Teaching Lisp by implementing Lisp is a long-standing tradition. We read book after book, lecture after lecture, blog post after blog post, all explaining how to implement Lisp in Lisp. Christian Queinnec's [Lisp in Small Pieces][LiSP] ("**LiSP**") is particularly notable, not just implementing a Lisp in Lisp, but covering a wide range of different semantics within Lisp.

**LiSP**'s approach is to introduce a feature of Lisp, then develop an implementation. The book covers [\Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2[^onevstwo], then discusses how to implement namespaces, building a simple Lisp-1 and a simple Lisp-2. Another chapter discusses scoping, and again you build interpreters for dynamic and block scoped Lisps.

[^onevstwo]: A "Lisp-1" has a single namespace for both functions and other values. A "Lisp-2" has separate namespaces for functions and other values. To the extend that JavaScript resembles a Lisp, it resembles a Lisp-1. See [The function namespace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace).

Building interpreters (and eventually compilers) may seem esoteric compared to tutorials demonstrating how to build a blogging engine, but there's a method to this madness. If you implement block scoping in a "toy" language, you gain a deep understanding of how closures really work in any language. You gain some insight into the implications with respect to memory and performance. If you write a Lisp that rewrites function calls in [Continuation Passing Style][CPS], you can't help but feel comfortable using JavaScript callbacks in [Node.js].

The simple fact is that *implementing* a language feature teaches you a tremendous amount about how the feature works in a relatively short amount of time. And that goes double for implementing variations on the same feature--like dynamic vs block scoping or single vs multiple namespaces.

That being said, you get the most mileage out of implementing language semantics, not language syntax. Semantics are the *meanings* of programs, syntax is merely the appearance. Writing parsers for both `compose = (a, b) -> (c) -> a(b(c))` in CoffeeScript and `function comnpose (a, b) { return function (c) { return a(b(c)); }; }` in JavaScript wouldn't teach you nearly as much as writing the code that implements closures. And it's the closures that make `compose` work the way it does.

In this book, we are going to implement a number of different programming language semantics, all in JavaScript. We won't be choosing features at random; We aren't going to try to implement every possible type of programming language semantics. We won't explore dynamic vs block scoping, we won't implement call-by-name, and we will ignore the temptation to experiment with lazy evaluation.

We *are* going to implement different object semantics, implement different kinds of metaobjects, and implement different kinds of method protocols. We are going to focus on the semantics of objects, metaobjects, and protocols, because we're interested in understanding "object-oriented programming" and all of its rich possibilities.

In doing so, we'll learn about the principles of object-oriented programming in far more depth than we would if we chose to implement a "practical" example like a blogging engine.
