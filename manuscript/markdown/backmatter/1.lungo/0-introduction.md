## Revisiting JavaScript Allongé

This book is written for the reader who has read [JavaScript Allongé](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge) or has equivalent familiarity with functions and basic use of JavaScript's objects, functions, closures, and the prototype chain. This chapter is intended as a refresher: Some of the material from JavaScript Allongé is abbreviated and reproduced.

In this chapter we'll discuss how JavaScript is typically used to create objects with methods using functions as constructors. Many people call these "classes," and that's fine.

In subsequent chapters, we'll go into much more detail about different patterns for developing methods and objects. Having these "standard" patterns in mind while we review alternatives will aid us to understand the tradeoffs that doing things in a different way may offer.
