## Encapsulation for Metaobjects

Encapsulation through proxies works well for *peers*, objects that are designed to primarily interact with each other. It prevents them from accessing each other's internal state.

Encapsulation was a revolutionary idea in the 1980s when Smalltalk launched, and an accepted good practice in the 1990s when Java rose to prominence. It is now a well-known design imperative. Paradoxically, that means that it often is not necessary to impose strict limitations on objects' abilities to interact with each other's internal state, because programmers are much less likely to attempt it today than they were in the 1980s when `C` was the popular language and manipulating structs was the popular paradigm.

In this decade, we are much more worried about metaobjects becoming coupled than we are about objects. As we discussed [earlier](#encapsulation-problem), when introducing the private mixins and forwarding, metaobjects quickly become coupled because of [open recursion][or].

[or]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_recursion#Open_recursion

By default, metaobjects like prototypes are tightly coupled to each other because they all manipulate their base object's properties. And while it is a more difficult problem to solve technically than the problem of coupling peer objects, it is more important to solve it because the problem is more widespread.

Like it or not, many programmers who are perfectly aware that objects should not manipulate each other's internal state will be surprised to learn that having "classes" manipulate an object's internal state has exactly the same consequences.

If we can find a way to manage the interface between an object and a metaobject, we can make our programs more robust and discourage others from carelessly introducing coupling.

### inner proxies

Our original proxy wrapped around an object, presenting an interface to the "outside world:"

![A proxy](images/7/proxy.png)

An object or function can also create its own proxy around an object:

![A proxy](images/7/inner_proxy.png)

Here's one way to use this. Recall our utility for creating a private mixin:

![extendPrivately](images/7/extendPrivately.png)

Note the highlighted expression. Every method we mix in shares the same new, empty object as its context. This separates them completely from the properties of any object they're mixed into.

Let's start with our code for creating proxies:

~~~~~~~~
function forward (receiver, metaobject, methods) {
  if (methods == null) {
    methods = Object.keys(metaobject).filter(function (methodName) {
      return typeof(metaobject[methodName]) == 'function';
    });
  }
  methods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    receiver[methodName] = function () {
      var result = metaobject[methodName].apply(metaobject, arguments);
      return result === metaobject ? this : result;
    };
  });

  return receiver;
}

function proxy(implementation, optionalMethods) {
  return forward(Object.create(null), implementation, optionalMethods);
}
~~~~~~~~

But now, let's rewrite the way we do "private" inheritance:

~~~~~~~~
function extendOverEncapsulation (receiver, mixin) {
  var methodName,
      context = proxy(receiver);

  for (methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      receiver[methodName] = mixin[methodName].bind(context);
    };
  };
  return receiver;
}
~~~~~~~~

Instead of extending an object with methods that only have access to a private object for holding their own state, we're extending an object with methods that have access to their own private state *and* to the methods of the object.

For example:

~~~~~~~~
var Person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
  rename: function (first, last) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    return this;
  }
};

var HasCareer = {
  career: function () {
    return this.chosenCareer;
  },
  setCareer: function (career) {
    this.chosenCareer = career;
    return this;
  },
  describe: function () {
    return this.fullName() + " is a " + this.chosenCareer;
  }
};

var samwise = {};

extendOverEncapsulation(samwise, Person);
extendOverEncapsulation(samwise, HasCareer);

samwise
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }
~~~~~~~~

Our new object has all the methods of both `Person` and `HasCareer`. Let's try it:

~~~~~~~~
samwise.rename('Sam', 'Wise')
samwise
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

samwise.setCareer('Companion');
samwise.describe
  //=> 'Sam Wise is a Companion'
~~~~~~~~

Our `describe` method has access to `HasCareer`'s private internal state and to `samwise`'s `fullName` method.

### an off-topic refinement

If you're "playing along at home," you may have noticed this:

~~~~~~~~
samwise.setCareer('Companion');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      chosenCareer: 'Companion' }
~~~~~~~~

The problem is that the `setCareer` method returns `this`, but when extended privately or encapsualtedly (we are making up words), `this` is the private state of the mixin, not the original object or its proxy.

There are fixes for this. For example:

~~~~~~~~
function extendOverEncapsulation (receiver, mixin) {
  var methodName,
      context = proxy(receiver);

  for (methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      (function (methodName) {
        receiver[methodName] = function () {
          var result = mixin[methodName].apply(context, arguments);
          return (result === context) ? receiver : result;
        };
      })(methodName);
    };
  };
  return receiver;
}

var pepys = {};

extendOverEncapsulation(pepys, Person);
extendOverEncapsulation(pepys, HasCareer);

pepys.rename('Samuel', 'Pepys');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

pepys.setCareer('Diarist');
  //=>
    { fullName: [Function],
      rename: [Function],
      career: [Function],
      setCareer: [Function],
      describe: [Function] }

pepys.describe();
  //=> 'Samuel Pepys is a Diarist'
~~~~~~~~

### proxies and prototypes

Let's try using our `extendOverEncapsulation` function with a singleton prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var prototype = {};

extendOverEncapsulation(prototype, Person);
extendOverEncapsulation(prototype, HasCareer);

var michael = Object.create(prototype);

michael.rename('Michael', 'Sam');
michael.fullName()
  //=> 'Michael Sam'
~~~~~~~~

So far, so good. Now let's use a *shared* prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var Careerist = {};

extendOverEncapsulation(Careerist, Person);
extendOverEncapsulation(Careerist, HasCareer);

var michael    = Object.create(Careerist),
    betwitched = Object.create(Careerist);

michael.rename('Michael', 'Sam');
betwitched.rename('Samantha', 'Stephens');

michael.fullName()
  //=> 'Samantha Stephens'
~~~~~~~~

Bzzzzzzzt! This does not work because each of our "encapsulated" mixins hash its own private state, but they are mixed into the shared prototype, so therefore the private state is shared as well.

We could get around this with [a pattern that has the shared prototype mix behaviour into singleton prototypes](#mix-into-singleton). But let's look at another mechanism, this one based on the *safekeeper* pattern:

### safekeeping for shared prototypes

Let's rewrite our extension function to store the private data in safekeeping:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function namedEncapsulation (receiver, name, mixin) {
  var methodName,
      safekeepingName;

  if (mixin == null) {
    mixin = name;
    safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__";
  }
  else safekeepingName = "__" + name + "__"

  for (methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      (function (methodName) {
        receiver[methodName] = function () {
          var context = this[safekeepingName],
              result = mixin[methodName].apply(context, arguments);
          if (context == null) {
            context = proxy(this);
            Object.defineProperty(this, safekeepingName, {
              enumerable: false,
              writable: false,
              value: context
            });
          }
          return (result === context) ? this : result;
        };
      })(methodName);
    };
  };
  return receiver;
}
var Careerist = {};

namedEncapsulation(Careerist, Person);
namedEncapsulation(Careerist, HasCareer);

var michael    = Object.create(Careerist),
    betwitched = Object.create(Careerist);

michael.rename('Michael', 'Sam');
betwitched.rename('Samantha', 'Stephens');

michael.setCareer('Athlete');
betwitched.setCareer('Thaumaturge');

michael.fullName()
  //=> 'Michael Sam'

betwitched.career()
  //=> 'Thaumaturge'
~~~~~~~~
