## Encapsulation for Metaobjects

Encapsulation through proxies works well for *peers*, objects that are designed to primarily interact with each other. It prevents them from accessing each other's internal state.

Encapsulation was a revolutionary idea in the 1980s when Smalltalk launched, and an accepted good practice in the 1990s when Java rose to prominence. It is now a well-known design imperative. Paradoxically, that means that it often is not necessary to impose strict limitations on objects' abilities to interact with each other's internal state, because programmers are much less likely to attempt it today than they were in the 1980s when `C` was the popular language and manipulating structs was the popular paradigm.

In this decade, we are much more worried about metaobjects becoming coupled than we are about objects. As we discussed [earlier](#encapsulation-problem), when introducing the private mixins and forwarding, metaobjects quickly become coupled because of [open recursion][or].

[or]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_recursion#Open_recursion

By default, metaobjects like prototypes are tightly coupled to each other because they all manipulate their base object's properties. And while it is a more difficult problem to solve technically than the problem of coupling peer objects, it is more imprtant to solve it because the problem is more widespread.

Like it or not, many programmers who are perfectly aware that objects should not manipulate each other's internal state will be surprised to learn that having "classes" manipulate an object's internal state has exactly the same consequences.

If we can find a way to manage the interface between an object and a metaobject, we can make our programs more robust and discourage others from carelessly introducing coupling.

### inner proxies

Our original proxy wrapped around an object, presenting an interface to the "outside world:"

![A proxy](images/7/proxy.png)

An object or function can also create its own proxy around an object:

![A proxy](images/7/inner_proxy.png)

Here's one way to use this. Recall our utility for creating a private mixin:

![extendPrivately](images/7/extendPrivately.png)

Note the highlighted expression. Every method we mix in shares the same new, empty object as its context. This separates them completely from the properties of any object they're mixed into.

But consider:

~~~~~~~~
function forward (receiver, metaobject, methods) {
  if (methods == null) {
    methods = Object.keys(metaobject).filter(function (methodName) {
      return typeof(metaobject[methodName]) == 'function';
    });
  }
  methods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    receiver[methodName] = function () {
      var result = metaobject[methodName].apply(metaobject, arguments);
      return result === metaobject ? this : result;
    };
  });

  return receiver;
}

function proxy(implementation, optionalMethods) {
  return forward(Object.create(null), implementation, optionalMethods);
}

function extendOverEncapsulation (receiver, mixin) {
  var methodName,
      context = proxy(receiver);

  for (methodName in mixin) {
    if (mixin.hasOwnProperty(methodName)) {
      receiver[methodName] = mixin[methodName].bind(context);
    };
  };
  return receiver;
}
~~~~~~~~

This allows us to mix methods into an object, but the methods mixed in only have access to the
