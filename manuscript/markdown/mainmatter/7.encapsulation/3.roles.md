## Roles

Some objects have multiple responsibilities. A `Person` can be an `Author`, can `HaveChildren`, can `HaveInvestments` and so forth. Each particular responsibility can be cleanly separated into its own metaobject, and their state combined into one object with mixins, forwarding, delegation, prototype chaining, or some combination of techniques.

This cleanly separates the code we write along lines of responsibility, but it doesn't separate the object itself. This is a problem, because it introduces coupling. If we encapsulate the object, of course. However...

Consider the "surface area" of the object. encapsulating it so that we hide its private state reduces the surface area. But each responsibility we mix in increases the surface area, increases the ways in which objects can indirectly perturb its private state.

To further reduce coupling, we need to further reduce the surface area of the object. We need to reduce the number of methods other objects can invoke.
