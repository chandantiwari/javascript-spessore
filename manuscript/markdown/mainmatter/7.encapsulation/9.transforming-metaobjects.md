## Transforming Metaobjects

Going back to the [Big Idea](#big-idea), there is value in having an algebra of metaobjects. We've just seen a protocol for encapsulating and composing metaobjects: Encapsulation works with composition to decouple metaobjects from each other, which in turn makes it easy to cimbine and recombine them as needed to form new metaobjects.

Composition is not the only mechanism for building metaobjects from other metaobjects. We can also *transform* metaobjects into new metaobjects. We've already seen one such transformation: `encapsulate` transformed an unencapsulated metaobject into an encpsulated metaobject.

Here's another function that transforms a metaobject into another metaobject:

~~~~~~~~
function fluentByDefault (metaobject) {
	var metaproto = Object.getPrototypeOf(metaobject),
	    fluentMetaobject = Object.create(metaproto),
	    key;
		
	for (key in metaobject) {
		if (typeof metaobject[key] === 'function') {
			!function (key) {
				fluentMetaobject[key] = function () {
					var returnValue = metaobject[key].apply(this, arguments);
					
					return typeof returnValue === 'undefined'
					       ? this
								 : returnValue;
				}
			}(key);
		}
	}
	return fluentMetaobject;
}
~~~~~~~~

This takes a metaobject and returns another metaobject. The new metaobject delegates all of its methods to the original, but its retrun value protocol is decorated: any method that returns `undefined` will return `this` instead.

Note that we are not modifying a metaobject in place. Consider:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
});

var FluentSongwriter = fluentByDefault(Songwriter);

var hall  = Object.create(Songwriter).initialize(),
    oates = Object.create(FluentSongwriter).initialize();
		
hall
	//=> undefined
oates
	//=> {}
	
oates.addSong("your kiss is on my list");
oates.songs()
	//=> ["your kiss is on my list"]
~~~~~~~~
