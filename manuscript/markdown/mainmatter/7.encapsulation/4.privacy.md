## Privacy

Our `encapsulate` function sets up a sharp demarcation: An encapsulated metaobject has one or more methods that are visible to other objects. Those "public" methods can update and query properties, but the properties are hidden from the public. The properties are "private."

This scheme is perfectly [cromulent] for metaobjects that represent small, focused and simple responsibilities. But what if we have a metaobject with complex internal structure and workings?

[cromulent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromulent#Embiggen_and_cromulent "Lisa the Iconoclast"

We may, for example, wish to take a code fragment and group it together, giving it a name and making it obvious that it represents a single responsibility. We could turn this:[^extractMethod]

[^extractMethod]: This example of the [Extract Method](http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) refactoring comes from Martin Fowler's excellent [Catalogue of Refactorings](http://refactoring.com/catalog/).

~~~~~~~~
var Account = encapsulate({
  getOutstanding: function () {
    // ...elided...
  },
  printOwing: function () {
    this.printBanner();

    //print details
    console.log("name:  " + this._name);
    console.log("amount " + this.getOutstanding());

    return this;
  }
  // ...elided...
});
~~~~~~~~

Into this:

~~~~~~~~
var Account = encapsulate({
  getOutstanding: function () {
    // ...elided...
  },
  printOwing: function () {
    this.printBanner();
    this.printDetails();

    return this;
  },
  printDetails: function () {
    console.log("name:  " + this._name);
    console.log("amount " + this.getOutstanding());

    return this;
  }
  // ...elided...
});
~~~~~~~~

This works, however `printDetails` is public: This increases the surface area of our `Account` metaobject by exposing another method. Furthermore, exposing a method that `printOwing` itself calls means that its dependents include all of the objects that have method that invoke `printDetails` directly *or* invoke it indirectly by invoking `printOwning`.

`printDetails` is, thankfully, a query. Consider this similar example featuring a helper method that performs an update:

~~~~~~~~
var Account = encapsulate({
  credit: function (amount) {
    // ...elided...
  },
  debit: function (amount) {
    // ...elided...
  },
  processCheque: function (cheque) {
    // ...elided...
    transferTo(cheque.depositAccount, cheque.amount);

    return this;
  },
  transferTo: function (otherAccount, amount) {
    this.credit(amount);
    otherAccount.debit(amount);

    return this;
  }
  // ...elided...
});
~~~~~~~~

`transferTo` is public, and affects the internal state of an account. Therefore, exposing it to the world immediately couples every piece of code that invokes it with every piece of code that depends upon the state of an account's balance.

The ideal situation is to avoid making such "helper methods" public. For example, we can take advantage of JavaScript's closures and convert the methods into helper functions:

~~~~~~~~
function transferTo (fromAccount, toAccount, amount) {
  fromAccount.credit(amount);
  toAccount.debit(amount);

  return fromAccount;
}

var Account = encapsulate({
  credit: function (amount) {
    // ...elided...
  },
  debit: function (amount) {
    // ...elided...
  },
  processCheque: function (cheque) {
    // ...elided...
    transferTo(this, cheque.depositAccount, cheque.amount);

    return this;
  }
  // ...elided...
});
~~~~~~~~

This one works very well because it doesn't actually use any of an account's internal private state. But it wouldn't work if it needed to mutate the balance directly,a s the private state is encapsulated.

What if we want to make a method that has access to the encapsulated metaobject's private state but is not visible outside of the metaobject?

Let's review the architecture. An account looks like this:

![AccountEncapulation](images/7/encapsulation.png)

The `encapsulate` function structures each object so that there is an unenumerated, "hidden" object representing private state, and each method executes in that object's context.

Now we want to have a method that is hidden from the public, but available to each method. Well, the answer writes itself when you ask the question the right way:

![Account Private Method](images/7/private.png)

If we want a private method that is available only to our public methods, we should place it in the object we already have that holds private state for our public methods.
