# Metaobjects

## templates and creation by value

## immediate, forward, and late-binding of metaobjects

## degenerate protocols

## eigenclasses, again

## prototypes vs. classes: metaobject-1s vs. metaobject-2s

## contracts and liskov equivalence

## metaobjects are not types, and types are not interfaces
