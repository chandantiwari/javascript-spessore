> ‘Functional programming’ is something of a misnomer, in that it leads a lot of people to think of it as meaning ‘programming with functions’, as opposed to programming with objects. But if object-oriented programming treats everything as an object, functional programming treats everything as a value – not just functions, but everything. This of course includes obvious things like numbers, strings, lists, and other data, but also other things we OOP fans don’t typically think of as values: IO operations and other side effects, GUI event streams, null checks, even the notion of sequencing function calls. If you’ve ever heard the phrase ‘programmable semicolons’ you’ll know what I’m getting at.--James Coglan, [Callbacks are imperative, promises are functional](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/03/30/callbacks-are-imperative-promises-are-functional-nodes-biggest-missed-opportunity/)
