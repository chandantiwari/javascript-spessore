## Why objects matter

*Coming soon*.

### abstraction

Stepping away from the precise idea of an object, there is a general principle here, that of abstraction: An *abstraction* is an idea that is independent of it specifics and implementation. For example, a "map" or "dictionary" is an abstraction representing a mapping from keys to values. A "HashMap" is a specific kind of map that distributes values in buckets by hashing their keys.[^abstract]

The notion of abstraction implies some interesting things like information hiding. In the case of a map, some code that uses a map can be ignorant of whether a specific map instance is implemented with a hash or is a na√Øve list of key-value pairs.
