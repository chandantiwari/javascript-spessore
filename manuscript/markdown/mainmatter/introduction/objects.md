## What is an Object?

Consider Smalltalk's definition of an object:

> A Smalltalk object can do exactly three things: Hold state (references to other objects), receive a message from itself or another object, and in the course of processing a message, send messages to itself or another object.â€”[Smalltalk on Wikipedia][smalltalk]

[smalltalk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk

Objects seem simple enough: They hold state, they receive messages, they process those messages, and in the course of processing messages, they also send messages. This brief definition implies an important idea: Objects can *change state* in the course of processing messages. They do this directly by removing, changing, or adding to the references they hold.

### messages and method invocations

Smalltalk speaks of "messages." The metaphor of a message is very clear. A message is composed and sent from one entity (the "sender") to one entity (the "recipient"). The sender specifies the identity of the recipient. The message may contain information for the recipient, instructions to perform some task, or a question to be answered. An immediate reply may be requested, or the sender may trust the message's recipient to act appropriately. The metaphor of the "message" emphasizes the arms-length relationship between sender and recipient.[^protocols]

[^protocols]: More exotic messaging protocols are possible. Instead of a message being couriered from one entity to another entity, it could be posted on a public or semi-private space where many recipients could view it and decide for themselves whether to respond. Or perhaps there is a dispatching entity that examines each message and decides who ought to respond, much as an operator might direct your call to the right person within an organization.

Popular languages don't usually discuss messages. Instead, they speak of "invoking methods." The word "invoke" means to conjure up and to declare in law. "Invoking a method" has a much more imperative implication than "sending a message." It implies that the entity doing the invoking knows exactly what is going to happen. The relationship is not arms-length.

A method is a kind of recipe. It represents how an object will respond to a message. In JavaScript, methods are functions. In other languages, methods are a separate kind of thing than functions.

### references and state

You can imagine sending a message to a mathematician: "What's the biggest number: one, five, or four?" You can do that is JavaScrip as well:

    Math.max(1, 5, 4)
      //=> 5

Although this is a message, it is unsatisfying to think of `Math` as an object, because it doesn't have any state. Objects were invented fifty years ago[^Simula] to model entities when building simulations. When making a simulation, an essential design technique is to make provide entity with its own independent decision-making ability.

[^Simula]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula "The Simula Programming Language"

Let's say we're modeling traffic. In real life, each car has its own characteristics like maximum speed. Each car has a driver with their own particular style of driving, and of course different cars have different destinations and perhaps different senses of urgency. Each driver independently responds to the local situation around their car. The same goes for traffic lights, roads... Everything has its own independent behavior.

The way to build a simulation is to provide each simulated entity such as the cars, roads, and traffic lights, with their own little programs. You then embed them in a simulated city with a supervisory program doling out events such as rain. Finally, you start the simulation and see what happens.

The key need is to be able to have entities be independent decision-making units that respond to events from outside of themselves. In essence, we're describing computing units. Computation has, at its heart, a program and some kind of storage representing its state. Although impractical, each entity in a simulation could be a Turing Machine with a long tape.

And thus when we think of "objects," we think of independent computing devices, each with their own storage representing their state.

### the javascript state of affairs

In JavaScript, objects have one obvious way to represent state. All JavaScript objects can store references to values by key. For example:

    var snafu = { acronym: 'SNAFU', full: "Situation Normal, All Feduck Up" };
    var fubar = { acronym: 'FUBAR', full: "Feduck Up Beyond All Recognition" };

In JavaScript, an object can store any value by associating a reference to that value with a key. JavaScript objects are values, so you can also write:

    var dictionary = {
      snafu: { acronym: 'SNAFU', full: "Situation Normal, All Feduck Up" },
      fubar: { acronym: 'FUBAR', full: "Feduck Up Beyond All Recognition" }
    };

JavaScript functions are values, so you can easily associate functions with keys:

    var math = {
      plusOne: function (number) { return number + 1; }
      minusOne: function (number) { return number - 1; }
    };

While these are all technically objects, they miss the essence of objects, namely that they are not independent decision-making units with their own storage. Here's something a little closer to the Smalltalk notion of an object:

    var counter = {
      state: 0,
      prev: function () { return --counter.state; },
      succ: function () { return ++counter.state; }
    };

This object has two functions, but they are not simply values hanging off it. They are methods, they exist to query and modify the counter's state. When we write:

    counter.succ();
      //=> 1

We are sending the `succ` message to the counter, and it is responding to our message with `1`. This is a very simple example of what we can call a "proper" object, an object that has state and methods that interact with its own state.

In the Smalltalk ideal the only way for objects to interact with each other is through messages. This is not the case in JavaScript. In our above example, we can directly mutate the counter's state without sending it a message:

    counter.state = 42;
      //=> 42

    counter.succ();
      //=> 43

In JavaScript, object state is not private by default. You have to either find a way to hide object state, or you have to employ a convention of not having objects meddle with each other's internals.

### so what is an object?

In summary, an object is an entity that use handlers to respond to messages. It maintains internal state, and its handlers are responsible for querying and/or updating its state. In a language like JavaScript, we reply on convention to prevent objects from meddling with each other's internal state.
