## The Expression Problem {#expression-problem}

The [Expression Problem] is a programming design challenge: Given two orthogonal concerns of equal importance, how do we express our programming solution in such a way that neither concern becomes secondary?

[Expression Problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem

An example given in the [c2 wiki] concerns a set of shapes (circle, square) and a set of calculations on those shapes (circumference, area).  We could write this using metaobjects:

~~~~~~~~
var Square = encapsulate({
	constructor: function (length) {
		this.length = length;
	},
	circumference: function () {
		return this.length * 4;
	},
	area: function () {
		return this.length * this.length;
	}
});

var Circle = encapsulate({
	constructor: function (radius) {
		this.radius = radius;
	},
	circumference: function () {
		return Math.PI * 2.0 * this.radius;
	},
	area: function () {
		return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
	}
});
~~~~~~~~

Or functions on structs:

~~~~~~~~
var Square = Struct('Square', 'length');
var Circle = Struct('Circle', 'radius');

function circumference(shape) {
	if (Square(shape)) {
		return shape.length * 4;
	}
	else if (Circle(shape)) {
		return Math.PI * 2.0 * this.radius;
	}
}

function area (shape) {
	if (Square(shape)) {
		return this.length * this.length;
	}
	else if (Circle(shape)) {
		return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
	}
}
~~~~~~~~

Both of these operations make one thing a first-class citizen and the the other a second-class citizen. The object solution makes shapes first-class, and operations second-class. The function solution makes operations first-class, and shapes second-class. We can see this by adding new functionality:

1. If we add a new shape (e.f. `Triangle`), it's easy with the object solution: Everything you need to know about a triangle goes in one place. But it's hard with the function solution: We have to carefully add a case to each function covering triangles.
1. If we add a new operation, (e.g. `boundingBox` returns the smallest square that encloses the shape), it's easy with the function solution: we add a new function and make sure it has a case for each kind of shape. But it's hard with the object solution: We have to make sure that we add a new method to each object.

I> The expression problem originated as follows: Given a set of entities and a set of operations on those entities, how do we add new entities and new operations, without recompiling, without unsafe operations like casts, and while maintaining type safety?

I> The general form of the problem does not concern type safety, but does concern the elegance of the design.

In a simple (two objects and two methods) example, the expression problem does not seem like much of a stumbling block. But imagine we are operating at scale, with a hierarchy of classes that have methods at every level of the ontology. Adding new operations can be messy, especially in a language that does not have type checking to make sure we cover all of the appropriate cases.

And the functions-first approach is equally messy in contemporary software. It's a very sensible technique when we program with a handful of canonical data structures and want to make many operations on those data structures. This is why, despite decades of attempts to write Object-Relational Mapping libraries, [PL/SQL] is not going away. Given a slowly-changing database schema, it's far easier to write a new procedure that operates across tables, than to try to write methods on objects representing a single entity in a table.
