## Structural vs. Semantic Typing

A long-cherished principle of dynamic languages is that programs employ "Duck" or "Structural" typing. So if we write:

~~~~~~~~
function deposit (account, instrument) {
  account.dollars += instrument.dollars;
  account.cents   += instrument.cents;
  account.dollars += Math.floor(account.cents / 100);
  account.cents    = account.cents % 100;
  return account;
}
~~~~~~~~

This works for things that look like cheques, and for things that look like money orders:[^wellactually]

~~~~~~~~
cheque = {
  dollars: 100,
  cents: 0,
  number: 6
}

deposit(currentAccount, cheque);

moneyOrder = {
  dollars: 100,
  cents: 0,
  fee: 1.50
}

deposit(currentAccount, moneyOrder);
~~~~~~~~

[^wellactually]: There're good things we can say about why we should consider making an `amount` property, and/or encapsulate these structs so they behave like objects, but this gives the general idea of structural typing.

The general idea here is that as long as we pass `deposit` an `instrument` that has `dollars` and `cents` properties, the function will work. We can think about `hasDollarsAndCents` as a "type," and we can say that programming in a dynamic language like JavaScript is programming in a world where there is a many-many relationship between types and entities.

Every single entity that has `dollars` and `cents` has the imaginary type `hasDollarsAndCents`, and every single function that takes a parameter and uses only its `dollars` and `cents` properties is a function that requires a parameter of type `hasDollarsAndCents`.

There is no checking of this in advance, like some other languages, but there also isn't any explicit declaration of these types. They exist logically in the running system, but not manifestly in the code we write.

This maximizes flexibility, in that it encourages the creation of small, independent pieces work seamlessly together. It also makes it easy to refactor to small, independent pieces. The code above could easily be changed to something like this:

~~~~~~~~
cheque = {
  amount: {
    dollars: 100,
    cents: 0
  },
  number: 6
}

deposit(currentAccount, cheque.amount);

moneyOrder = {
  amount: {
    dollars: 100,
    cents: 0
  },
  fee: 1.50
}

deposit(currentAccount, moneyOrder.amount);
~~~~~~~~

### drawbacks

This flexibility has a cost. With our ridiculously simple example above, we can easy deposit new kinds of instruments. But we can also do things like this:

~~~~~~~~
var backTaxesOwed = {
  dollars: 10,874,
  cents: 06
}

var rentReceipt = {
  dollars: 420,
  cents: 0,
  unit: 504,
  month: 6,
  year: 1962
}

deposit(backTaxesOwed, rentReceipt);
~~~~~~~~

Structurally, `deposit` is compatible with any two things that `haveDollarsAndCents`. But not all things that `haveDollarsAndCents` are semantically appropriate for deposits. This is why some OO language communities work very hard developing and using type systems that incorporate semantics.

This is not just a theoretical concern. Numbers and strings are the ultimate in semantic-free data types. Confusing metric with imperial measures is thought to have caused the loss of the [Mars Climate Orbiter]. To prevent mistakes like this in software, forcing values to have compatible semantics--and not just superficially compatible structure--is thought to help create self-documenting code and to surface bugs.

### semantic structs

We've already seen [Structs](#structs):

~~~~~~~~
function Struct (template) {
  if (Struct.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)) {
    var struct = this;

    Object.keys(template).forEach(function (key) {
      Object.defineProperty(struct, key, {
        enumerable: true,
        writable: true,
        value: template[key]
      });
    });
    return Object.preventExtensions(struct);
  }
  else return new Struct(template);
}
~~~~~~~~

`Struct` is a structural type, not a semantic type. But it can be extended to incorporate the notion of semantic types by turning it from and object factory into a "factory-factory." Here's a completely new version of `Struct`, we give it a name and the keys we want, and it gives us a JavaScript constructor function:

~~~~~~~~
function Struct () {
  var name = arguments[0],
      keys = [].slice.call(arguments, 1),
      constructor = eval("(function "+name+"(argument) { return initialize.call(this, argument); })");

  function initialize (argument) {
    if (constructor.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)) {
      var struct = this;

      keys.forEach(function (key) {
        Object.defineProperty(struct, key, {
          enumerable: true,
          writable: true,
          value: argument[key]
        });
      });
      return Object.preventExtensions(struct);
    }
    else return new constructor(argument);
  };

  return constructor;
}

var Depositable = Struct('Depositiable', 'dollars', 'cents'),
    RecordOfPayment = Struct('RecordOfPayment', 'dollars', 'cents');

var cheque = new Depositable({dollars: 420, cents: 0});

cheque.constructor;
  //=> [Function: Depositiable]

cheque instanceof Depositable;
  //=> true
cheque instanceof RecordOfPayment;
  //=> false
~~~~~~~~

Although `Depositable` and `RecordOfPayment` have the same structural type, they are different semantic types, and we can detect the difference with `instanceof` (and `Object.isPrototypeOf`).

We can also bake this test into our constructors. The code above uses a pattern borrowed from [Effective JavaScript] so that you can write either `new Depositable(...)` or `Depositable(...)` and always get a new instance of `Depositable`. This version abandons that convention in favour of making `Depositable` a prototype check, and adds an explicit assertion method:

[Effective JavaScript]: http://effectivejs.com

~~~~~~~~
function Struct () {
  var name = arguments[0],
      keys = [].slice.call(arguments, 1),
      constructor = eval("(function "+name+"(argument) { return initialize.call(this, argument); })");

  function initialize (argument) {
    if (constructor.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)) {
      var argument = argument,
          struct = this;

      keys.forEach(function (key) {
        Object.defineProperty(struct, key, {
          enumerable: true,
          writable: true,
          value: argument[key]
        });
      });
      return Object.preventExtensions(struct);
    }
    else return constructor.prototype.isPrototypeOf(argument);
  };

  constructor.assertIsPrototypeOf = function (argument) {
    if (!constructor.prototype.isPrototypeOf(argument)) {
      var name = constructor.name === ''
                 ? "Struct(" + keys.join(", ") + ")"
                 : constructor.name;
      throw "Type Error: " + argument + " is not a " + name;
    }
    else return argument;
  }

  return constructor;
}

var Depositable = Struct('Depositable', 'dollars', 'cents'),
    RecordOfPayment = Struct('RecordOfPayment', 'dollars', 'cents');

var cheque = new Depositable({dollars: 420, cents: 0});

Depositable(cheque);
  //=> true

RecordOfPayment.assertIsPrototypeOf(cheque);
  //=> Type Error: [object Object] is not a RecordOfPayment
~~~~~~~~

We can use these "semantic" structs by adding assertions to critical functions:

~~~~~~~~
function deposit (account, instrument) {
  Depositable.assertIsPrototypeOf(instrument);

  account.dollars += instrument.dollars;
  account.cents   += instrument.cents;
  account.dollars += Math.floor(account.cents / 100);
  account.cents    = account.cents % 100;
  return account;
}
~~~~~~~~

### is-a and was-a

Words like "delegate" are carefully chosen to say nothing about semantic relationships. Given:

~~~~~~~~
function C () {}

C.prototype.iAm = function () { return "a C"; };

var a = new C();

a.iAm();
  //=> 'a C'

a instanceof C
  //=> true
~~~~~~~~

We can say that the entity `a` delegates handling of the method `iAm` to its prototype. But what is the relationship between `a` and `C`? What is this "instance of?"

In programming, there are two major kinds relationships between entities and metaobjects (be those metaobjects mixins, classes, prototypes, or anything else). First, there is a semantic relationship. We call this **is-a**. If we say that `a` is-a `C`, we are saying that there is some valuable meaning to the idea that there is a set of all `C`s and that `a` belonging to that set matters.

The second is an implementation relationship. We have various names for this depending on how we implement things. We can say `a` delegates-to `C`. We can say `a` uses `C`. We sometimes arrange things so that `a` is-composed-of mixin `M`.

When we have an implementation relationship, we are saying that there is no meaningful set of entities, the relationship is purely one of convenience. Sometimes, we use physical inheritance, like a prototype, but we don't care about a semantic relationship, it's simply a mechanism for sharing some behaviour.

When we use inheritance but don't care about semantics, we call the relationship **was-a**. `a` was-a `C` means that we are not asserting that it is meaningful to say that `a` is a member of the set of all `C`s.

A> My cargo bug is-a beetle. It's recognizable as a beetle. And everywhere I could use a beetle, I can use my cargo bug. This is the is-a relationship of programming, there is some set of functions, and they we are saying that they are valid for all "b" where "b is-a beetle." My cargo bug is a beetle, so we know that our functions are valid when they operate on it.

A> A dune buggy is not a beetle. It doesn't look like a beetle. It *was* a beetle, but now it's a dune buggy. "was-a" is a relationship that describes one object using another object for its implementation, but there is no equivalence implied. "was-a" is a relationship of convenience.
