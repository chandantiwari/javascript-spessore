## Multiple Dispatch

In [The Expression Problem](#expression-problem), we saw that JavaScript's single-dispatch system made it difficult to model interactions that varied on two (or more) semantic types. Our example was modeling collisions between fighters and meteors, where we want to have different outcomes depending upon whether a fighter or a meteor collided with another fighter or a meteor.

Languages such as [Common Lisp] bake support for this problem right in, by supporting multiple dispatch. With multiple dispatch, generic functions can be specialized depending upon any of their arguments. In this example, we're defining forms of `collide` to work with a meteors and fighters:

[Common Lisp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp

{lang="lisp"}
~~~~~~~~
(defmethod collide ((object-1 meteor) (object-2 fighter))
   (format t "meteor ~a collides with fighter ~a" object-1 object-2))

(defmethod collide ((object-1 meteor) (object-2 meteor))
   (format t "meteor ~a collides with another meteor ~a" object-1 object-2))
~~~~~~~~

Common Lisp's generic functions use dynamic dispatch on both `object-1` and `object-2` to determine which body of `collide` to evaluate. Meaning, both types are checked at run time, at the time when the function is invoked. Since more than one argument is checked dynamically, we say that Common Lisp has *multiple dispatch*.

Manifestly typed OO languages like Java *appear* to support multiple dispatch. You can create one method with several signatures, something like this:

{lang="java"}
~~~~~~~~
interface Collidable {
  public void crashInto(Meteor meteor);
  public void crashInto(Fighter fighter);
}

class Meteor implements Collidable {
  public void crashInto(Meteor meteor);
  public void crashInto(Fighter fighter);
}

class Fighter implements Collidable {
  public void crashInto(Meteor meteor);
  public void crashInto(Fighter fighter);
}
~~~~~~~~

Alas this won't work. Although we can specialize `crashInto` by the type of its argument, the Java compiler resolves this specialization at compile time, not run time. It's *early bound*. Thus, if we write something like this pseudo-Java:

~~~~~~~~
Collidable thingOne = Math.random() < 0.5 ? new Meteor() : new Fighter(),
Collidable thingTwo = Math.random() < 0.5 ? new Meteor() : new Fighter();

thingOne.crashInto(thingTwo);
~~~~~~~~

It won't even compile! The compiler can figure out that `thingOne` is a `Collidable` and that it has two different signatures for the `crashInto` method, but all it knows about `thingTwo` is that it's a `Collidable`, the compiler doesn't know if it should be compiling an invocation of `crashInto(Meteor meteor)` or `crashInto(Fighter fighter)`, so it refuses to compile this code.

Java's system uses dynamic dispatch for the receiver of a method: The class of the receiver is determined at run time and the appropriate method is determined based on that class. But it uses *static dispatch* for the specialization based on arguments: The compiler sorts out which specialization to invoke based on the declared type of the argument at compile time. If it can't sort that out, the code does not compile.

Java may have type signatures to specialize methods, but it is still *single dispatch*, just like JavaScript.

### emulating multiple dispatch

Javascript cannot do true multiple dispatch without some ridiculous greenspunning of method invocations. But we can fake it pretty reasonably using the same technique we used for emulating pattern matching.

We start with the same convention: Methods and functions must return *something* if they successfully hand a method invocation, or raise an exception if they catastrophically fail. They cannot return `undefined` (which in JavaScript, also includes not explicitly returning something).

Recall that this allowed us to write the `Match` function that took a serious of *guards*, functions that checked to see if the value of arguments was correct for each case. Our general-purpose guard, `when`, took all of the arguments as parameters.

~~~~~~~~
function nameAndLength(name, length, body) {
  var abcs = [ 'q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'y', 'u', 'i', 'o', 'p',
               'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l',
               'z', 'x', 'c', 'v', 'b', 'n', 'm' ],
      pars = abcs.slice(0, length),
      src  = "(function " + name + " (" + pars.join(',') + ") { return body.apply(this, arguments); })";

  return eval(src);
}

function imitate(exemplar, body) {
  return nameAndLength(exemplar.name, exemplar.length, body);
}

function getWith (prop, obj) {
  function gets (obj) {
    return obj[prop];
  }

  return obj === undefined
         ? gets
         : gets(obj);
}

function mapWith (fn, mappable) {
  function maps (collection) {
    return collection.map(fn);
  }

  return mappable === undefined
         ? maps
         : maps(collection);
}

function pluckWith (prop, collection) {
  var plucker = mapWith(getWith(prop));

  return collection === undefined
         ? plucker
         : plucker(collection);
}

function Match () {
  var fns     = [].slice.call(arguments, 0),
      lengths = pluckWith('length', fns),
      length  = Math.min.apply(null, lengths),
      names   = pluckWith('name', fns).filter(function (name) { return name !== ''; }),
      name    = names.length === 0
                ? ''
                : names[0];

  return nameAndLength(name, length, function () {
    var i,
        value;

    for (i in fns) {
      value = fns[i].apply(this, arguments);

      if (value !== undefined) return value;
    }
  });
}
~~~~~~~~

What we want is to write guards for each argument. So we'll write `whenArgsAre`, a guard that takes predicates for each argument as well as the body of the function case:

~~~~~~~~
function isType (type) {
  return function (arg) {
    return typeof(arg) === type;
  };
}

function instanceOf (clazz) {
  return function (arg) {
    return arg instanceof clazz;
  };
}

function isPrototypeOf (proto) {
  return Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf.bind(proto);
}

function whenArgsAre () {
  var matchers = [].slice.call(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1),
      body     = arguments[arguments.length - 1];

  function typeChecked () {
    var i,
        arg,
        value;

    if (arguments.length != matchers.length) return;
    for (i in arguments) {
      arg = arguments[i];
      if (!matchers[i].call(this, arg)) return;
    }
    value = body.apply(this, arguments);
    return value === undefined
           ? null
           : value;
  }

  return imitate(body, typeChecked);
}

function Fighter () {};
function Meteor () {};

var handlesManyCases = Match(
  whenArgsAre(
    instanceOf(Fighter), instanceOf(Meteor),
    function (fighter, meteor) {
      return "a fighter has hit a meteor";
    }
  ),
  whenArgsAre(
    instanceOf(Fighter), instanceOf(Fighter),
    function (fighter, fighter) {
      return "a fighter has hit another fighter";
    }
  ),
  whenArgsAre(
    instanceOf(Meteor), instanceOf(Fighter),
    function (meteor, fighters) {
      return "a meteor has hit a fighter";
    }
  ),
  whenArgsAre(
    instanceOf(Meteor), instanceOf(Meteor),
    function (meteor, meteor) {
      return "a meteor has hit another meteor";
    }
  )
);

handlesManyCases(new Meteor(),  new Meteor());
  //=> 'a meteor has hit another meteor'
handlesManyCases(new Fighter(), new Meteor());
  //=> 'a fighter has hit a meteor'
~~~~~~~~

Our `MultipleDispatch` function now allows us to build generic functions that dynamically dispatch on all of their arguments. They work just fine for creating multiply dispatched methods:

~~~~~~~~
var FighterPrototype = {},
    MeteorPrototype  = {};

FighterPrototype.crashInto = Match(
  whenArgsAre(
    isPrototypeOf(FighterPrototype),
    function (fighter) {
      return "fighter(fighter)";
    }
  ),
  whenArgsAre(
    isPrototypeOf(MeteorPrototype),
    function (fighter) {
      return "fighter(meteor)";
    }
  )
);

MeteorPrototype.crashInto = Match(
  whenArgsAre(
    isPrototypeOf(FighterPrototype),
    function (fighter) {
      return "meteor(fighter)";
    }
  ),
  whenArgsAre(
    isPrototypeOf(MeteorPrototype),
    function (meteor) {
      return "meteor(meteor)";
    }
  )
);

var someFighter = Object.create(FighterPrototype),
    someMeteor  = Object.create(MeteorPrototype);

someFighter.crashInto(someMeteor);
  //=> 'fighter(meteor)'
~~~~~~~~

We now have usable dynamic multiple dispatch for generic functions and for methods. It's built on [pattern matching](#pattern-matching), so it can be extended to handle other forms of guarding.

### two caveats

This type of pattern matching works with semantic types, but methods we build with it are ignorant of their own inheritance chain. For example, we could incorporate an `ArmoredFighter` that behaves just like a regular fighter, only when it strikes another fighter it has some special behaviour.

It's useful to be able to write something like this:

~~~~~~~~
var ArmoredFighterPrototype = Object.create(FighterPrototype);

ArmoredFighterPrototype.crashInto = Match(
  whenArgsAre(
    isPrototypeOf(FighterPrototype),
    function (fighter) {
      return "armored-fighter(fighter)";
    }
  )
);
~~~~~~~~

The way prototypes work, objects that delegate to `ArmoredFighterPrototype` would get this `crashInto` behaviour, and thus could handle crashes between armored fighters and fighters of any description. But they would not get any behaviour to handle crashes between armored fighters and meteors, as this function "overrides" the behaviour in `FighterPrototype.crashInto`.

Logically, we can understand what's happening if we hold a little model of how JavaScript implements prototypical delegation in our head. But semantically, this seems wrong. If we override just one method signature in Java, the others are unaffected.

We have a slightly different problem if we compose two metaobjects that both have patterns for the same method, they may not compose exactly as we expect from a semantic perspective.

Our encapsulated metaobjects and our composition protocol both encourage the creation of a broad, shallow prototype hierarchy with as little chaining as possible. But for those times when we intentionally chain prototypes, we must be fully aware of the effect that overriding will have on our dispatched methods.
