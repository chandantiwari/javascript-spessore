## Shared Prototypes

In [Singleton Prototypes](#singleton-prototypes), we learned that we can create a ver simple object and associate it with a prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var Person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
  rename: function (first, last) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    return this;
  }
};

var sam = Object.create(Person);
~~~~~~~~

This associates behaviour with our object:

~~~~~~~~
sam.rename('sam', 'hill');
sam.fullName();
  //=> 'sam hill'
~~~~~~~~

There is no way to associate more than one prototype with the same object, but we can associate more than one object with the same prototype:

~~~~~~~~
var bewitched = Object.create(Person);
bewitched.rename('Samantha', 'Stephens');
~~~~~~~~

Although they share the prototype, their individual properties (as access with `this`), are separate:

~~~~~~~~
sam
  //=> { firstName: 'sam', lastName: 'hill' }
bewitched
  //=> { firstName: 'Samantha', lastName: 'Stephens' }
~~~~~~~~

This is very convenient.

### prototypes and mixins

If you're only going to mix *one* mixin into one or more objects, a prototype offers the same semantics, but is late bound and open for extension. It is usually preferred.

However, you cannot use prototypes to associate more than one metaobject with one or more objects. This limitation encourages prototypes to swell in functionality to accommodate all of the behaviours their objects will need: Separating multiple responsibilities into separate prototypes is problematic.

In [Singleton Prototypes](#singleton-prototypes), we saw the pattern of creatinga  prototype and then mixing behaviour into the prototype. This works with mixins and  shared prototypes as well as it works for singleton prototypes.

It does, however, not work as well for private mixins. And its behaviour may be surprising for forwarding and delegation.
