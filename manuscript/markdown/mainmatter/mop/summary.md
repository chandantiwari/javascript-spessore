## Summary

Metaobject protocols are vocabularies for accessing and manipulating the structure and behavior of objects. The protocols in this book will be implemented with three main entities:

* *Objects*: Objects are responsible for domain-specific properties.
* *Metaobjects*: Metaobjects are responsible for the insulating objects from the implementation of their behaviour.
* *Protocols*: Protocols are responsible for insulating other code from the implementation of metaobject behaviour.
