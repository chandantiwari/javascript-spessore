# Interlude: At home with the Bumblethwaites {#bumblethwaites}

*Any discussion about programming with objects turns inevitably to programming with "classes" and to "inheritance." Some will even construct elaborate ontologies of domain objects, saying things like "ChequingAccount is-a BankAccount," and "SignatureAccount is-a ChequingAccount."*

*Every programming language provides its own own unique combination of features and concepts, yet there are some ideas common to all object-oriented programming that we can grasp and use as the basis for writing our own programs. Since "inheritance" is a metaphor, we'll explain these concepts using a metaphor. Specifically, we'll talk about a family.*

Consider a programmer, Amanda Bumblethwaite.[^braithwaite] Amanda has several children, one of whom is Alex Bumblethwaite. Like many families, the Bumblethwaites have their own home in the *Apiary Meadows*, a suburban village. Although Alex is fairly independant, questions like "Can you come to a pajama party on Saturday night" are deferred to Amanda. Amanda taught each of her children how to write programs using [Squeak] and Lego Mindstorms.

[^braithwaite]: Amanda was born "Amanda Braithwaite," but changed surnames to "Bumblethwaite" in protest against a certain author of programming books.

What can we say about the Bumblethwaites?

### constructors

First, we can say that *Amanda is Alex's constructor*. Amanda provides 50% of the blueprint for making Alex, and Amanda actually carried out the work of bringing Alex into existence. (We'll hand-wave furiously about David Bumblethwaite's role.)

### formal classes

Second, we can say that "Bumblethwaite" is a *formal class*. Amanda is a member of the Bumblethwaite class, and so is Alex. The formal class itself has no physical existence. Amanda has a physical existence, and there is an understanding that all of Amanda's children are necessarily Bumblethwaites, but the concept of "Bumblethwaite-ness" is abstract.

### expectations

Because Amanda teaches all of her children how to program, knowing that Alex is a Bumblethwaite, we expect Alex to know how to program. Knowing that the Bumblethwaite live in Apiary Meadows, and knowing that Alex is a Bumblethwaite, we expect that Alex lives in Apiary Meadows.

### delegation

Alex *delegates* a lot of behaviour to Amanda. Meaning, that there are many choices she makes by asking Amanda what to do, and Amanda makes the choice based on Alex's interests, in Alex's context.

### ad hoc sets

While it's true that all Bumblethwaites are programmers, the concept of "being a programmer" is different than the concept of "being a Bumblethwaite." Membership in the "set of all programmers" is determined empirically: If a person programs, they are a programmer. It is possible for someone who doesn't program to become a programmer.

Membership in "The Bumblethwaites" is a more formal affair. You must be born a Bumblethwaite, and issued a birth certificate with "Bumblethwaite" on it. Or you must marry into the Bumblethwaites, again getting a piece of paper attesting to your "Bumblethwaite-ness."

Where "Bumblethwaite" is a formal class, "Programmer" is an ad hoc set.

These five ideas--constructors, formal classes, expectations, delegation, and ad hoc sets--characterize most ideas in object-oriented programming. Each programming language provides tools for expressing these ideas, although the languages tend to use the same words in slightly different ways.

JavaScript provides objects, functions and prototypes. The `new` keyword allows functions to be used as constructors. Prototypes are used for delegating behaviour. Just as Alex delegates behaviour to Amanda *and* Amanda constructs Alex, it is normal in JavaScript that a function is paired with a prototype to produce, through composition, an entity that handles construction and delegation of behaviour.

"Classic" JavaScript does not have the notion of a class, but JavaScript programmers often refer to such compositions as classes. JavaScript provides the `instanceof` operator to test whether an object was created by such a composite function. `instanceof` is a leaky abstraction, but it works well enough for treating constructer functions as formal classes.

### formal classes, expectations, and ad hoc sets

The distinction between "Bumblethwaite" and "Programmer" from our example above is a fundamental idea in object-oriented programming. Formal classes are a way of organizing knowledge about the domain and establishing expectations. By organizing constructors and prototypes in a certain way, we can set the expectation that all instances of "Bumblethwaite" can program.

Let's imagine that our definition of "is a programmer" is expressed as having a function called `writeFunction`:

    function isaProgrammer (candidate) {
      return typeof(candidate.writeFunction) === 'function';
    }

It's easy to imagine that "amanda is a programmer:"

    var amanda = {
      writeFunction: function (requirements) {
        var newFunction;
        // ... gimcrack code to convert formal requirements into a working function
        return newFunction;
      }
    };

    isaProgrammer(amanda)
      //=> true

We can say that "alex is a Bumblethwaite:"

    function Bumblethwaite () {}

    var alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    alex instanceof Bumblethwaite
      //=> true

We can say that every Bumblethwaite is created as a programmer:

    function Bumblethwaite () {
      this.writeFunction = function (requirements) {
        // ... better code to convert formal requirements into a working function
      }
    }

    var alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    isaProgrammer(alex)
      //=> true

Or even that the Bumblethwaites delegate their programming to Amanda:

    function Bumblethwaite () {}

    Bumblethwaite.prototype = amanda;

    alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    isaProgrammer(alex)
      //=> true

We are setting up the *expectation* that if `alex instanceof Bumblethwaite === true`, *then* `isaProgrammer(alex) === true`. Object-oriented programming is, at its heart, around organizing knowledge such that you can form and test such expectations.

### the i word

When we write:

    function Bumblethwaite () {}
    Bumblethwaite.prototype.writeFunction = function (requirements) {
      // ... code to convert formal requirements into a working function
    }

    alex = new Bumblethwaite();

One thing we can say about this code is that all Bumblethwaites can program, and since Alex is-a Bumblethwaite, Alex can program. As we saw above, this is a statement about a formal class, an expectation, delegation, and an ad hoc class. Most programmers don't bother going into all that detail: They say that "Alex is-a Braithwaite," and they say that "Alex inherits writeFunction from Bumblethwaite."

The "is-a" relationship expresses membership in a formal class and with it, a set of expectations. The exact implementation of those expectations--construction, delegation, composition, whatever--is not really part of saying "Alex is-a Bumblethwaite" or part of saying "Alex inherits writeFunction from Bumblethwaite."

Programmers often call this "interface inheritance,"[^java] where the word "interface" is reasonably close to "expectation."

[^java]: Java programmers sometimes say that the word "interface" applies only to the methods and signatures that are inherited, but that is far too narrow a view: An interface is a set of expectations that cover the methods and the behaviour they guarantee.

Sometimes people write code like this because it's a convenient way for objects to share behaviour. They aren't interested in formal classes. For example, you might write something like:

    var WritesFunctionsUsingCombinators = {
      writeFunction: function (requirements) {
        // I a saw a combinator pyramid.
        // It was all-encompassingly unnessesary.
      }
    }

    var raganwald = Object.create(WritesFunctionsUsingCombinators);

Here the object `raganwald` is a member of the ad hoc set "programmers" because it delegates `writeProgram` to `WritesFunctionsUsingCombinators`. But it isn't an `instanceof` anything. We aren't trying to establish a formal set and some expectations for a class of objects. We could, but we're choosing to use delegation as a convenience, as an implementation technique.

This has a common name as well, it's sometimes called "implementation inheritance" when it involved some of the same mechanisms as interface inheritance. (Old-timers will also call it a "was-a" relationship.[^was-a])

[^was-a]: Implementation inheritance "was-a" is named for historical reasons. The metaphor is of a dune buggy: A dune buggy *was* a Volkswagon Beetle, but now it's a dune buggy that uses the Volkswagon's implementation.

Most object-oriented languages tie interface and implementation inheritance together, but it's useful to understand and appreciate the difference between using techniques like delegation for inheriting "interfaces" vs inheriting "implementations."
