## Private Extension and Composition

There are two things we've ignored so far. Looking back at our introduction to [Metaobjects](#metaobjects), we discussed whether metaobjects had forwarding or delegation semantics. We also discussed whether metaobjects were open or closed for extension and we discussed whether the target for forwarding/delegation was early- or late-bound.

Our `encapsulate` function is *closed for modification*. Let's take another look at it:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function encapsulate (behaviour) {
  var safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__",
      definedMethods = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'function'),
      dependencies = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'undefined'),
      encapsulatedObject = {};

  function createContext (methodReceiver) {
    return partialProxy(methodReceiver, dependencies);
  }

  function getContext (methodReceiver) {
    var context = methodReceiver[safekeepingName];
    if (context == null) {
      context = createContext(methodReceiver);
      Object.defineProperty(methodReceiver, safekeepingName, {
        enumerable: false,
        writable: false,
        value: context
      });
    }
    return context;
  }

  definedMethods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    var methodBody = behaviour[methodName];

    encapsulatedObject[methodName] = function () {
      var context = getContext(this),
          result  = methodBody.apply(context, arguments);
      return (result === context) ? this : result;
    };
  });

  return encapsulatedObject;
}
~~~~~~~~

When we use `encapsulate` to create a metaobject, we associate each of the methods with a partial proxy for `this`:

![Songwriter](images/8/songwriter.png)

Once the metaobject has been created, there is (deliberately) no obvious way to access its partial proxy. For this reason, it is difficult to extend a metaobject created by encapsulate. If we try to replace an existing method, the new version will not have access to the proxy.

Here's a (slightly changed) version of `Songwriter` that completely hides its implementation of a songlist:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
    return this;
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  songlist: function () {
    return this._songs.join(', ');
  }
});
~~~~~~~~

We could *try* to modify it to produce a more readable songlist:

~~~~~~~~
function englishList (list) {
  var butLast = list.slice(0, list.length - 1),
      last = list[list.length - 1];
  return butLast.length > 0
         ? [butLast.join(', '), last].join(' and ')
         : last;
}

Songwriter.songlist = function () {
  return englishList(this._songs);
}
~~~~~~~~

This won't work, the replacement method will not access the partial proxy, but instead its context will be `this` directly:

![Songwriter, extended](images/8/songwriter-extended.png)

This is not what we want! Open recursion (unrestricted access to `this`) re-introduces the coupling we worked so hard to avoid. And, the method won't work because `_songs` is a property of the partial proxy, not of the underlying `this`.

The same is true if we tried to add a new method. Encapsulated behaviours are *closed for extension* as well as being *closed for extension*.

This is terrible if we like the free-wheeling "monkey-patching" style of metaprogramming popular in the Ruby community, but our code is actually doing its job properly by enfording clearly defined limits on how disparate pieces of code can influence each other's behaviour.

The one drawback of our code is that it lies: You *can* add or change a method, but it doesn't really work. It would be far better to catch these incorrect practices earlier.

We can prevent methods from being replaced using `Object.defineProperty` and prevent new methods from being added with `Object.preventExtensions`:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function encapsulate (behaviour) {
  var safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__",
      definedMethods = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'function'),
      dependencies = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'undefined'),
      encapsulatedObject = {};

  function createContext (methodReceiver) {
    return partialProxy(methodReceiver, dependencies);
  }

  function getContext (methodReceiver) {
    var context = methodReceiver[safekeepingName];
    if (context == null) {
      context = createContext(methodReceiver);
      Object.defineProperty(methodReceiver, safekeepingName, {
        enumerable: false,
        writable: false,
        value: context
      });
    }
    return context;
  }

  definedMethods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    var methodBody = behaviour[methodName];

    Object.defineProperty(encapsulatedObject, methodName, {
      writeable: false,
      value: function () {
        var context = getContext(this),
            result  = methodBody.apply(context, arguments);
        return (result === context) ? this : result;
      }
    });
  });

  return Object.preventExtensions(encapsulatedObject);
}
~~~~~~~~

Now if we try to modify `Songwriter`, it won't work. If we're in "strict mode," we get an error:

~~~~~~~~
!function () {
  "use strict"
  Songwriter.songlist = function () {
    return englishList(this._songs)
  };
}();
  //=> TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'songlist' of #<Object>
~~~~~~~~

This forces us to build new functionality with `composeBehaviours` and using the tools we've designed to control coupling.

### is there a middle ground?

`composeBehaviours` is designed very carefully to restrict coupling between metaobjects to public methods, and even then only to public methods that each metaobject declares it needs to use.

This is a very good thing when two metaobjects are *peers*, when they both provide their own functionality that is only loosely related, if at all. But the scheme breaks down when we are attempting to decorate or enhance the functionality of an existing behaviour.

Sometimes we deliberately *want* to reach in and work with the "hidden" implementation details of a behaviour when writing an extended version of it.

By default, JavaScript makes this easy: If you want to make a `Songwriter` and then specialize it as an `EnglishSongsSongwriter`, you make unencapsulated prototypes and chain them together:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = {
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
    return this;
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  songlist: function () {
    return this._songs.join(', ');
  }
};

function englishList (list) {
  var butLast = list.slice(0, list.length - 1),
      last = list[list.length - 1];
  return butLast.length > 0
         ? [butLast.join(', '), last].join(' and ')
         : last;
}

var EnglishSongsSongwriter = Object.create(Songwriter);

EnglishSongsSongwriter.songlist = function () {
  return englishList(this._songs);
}

var nilsson = Object.create(EnglishSongsSongwriter).initialize();

nilsson.addSong('One');
nilsson.addSong('Cocoanut');

nilsson.songlist()
  //=> 'One and Cocoanut'
~~~~~~~~

As we've noted, the cost of this flexibility is rampant coupling as our programs grown beyond the trivial.

A> Question: If a program is small enough that you can use JavaScript's OOP without worrying about coupling, is it also small enough that you don't need OOP at all?

### privilege

We obviously don't want to concede encapsulation and composeable metaobjects just for the convenience of making it easy to specialize behaviour from time to time. Some languages solve this by allowing metaobjects to grant "privilege" to each other. In C++, for example, a class can declare that another class is a `friend`, granting it access to otherwise private internal state and methods.
