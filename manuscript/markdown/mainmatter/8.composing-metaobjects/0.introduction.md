# Introduction

We have posited that JavaScript's [Big Idea](#big-idea) is to use functions to create function and object algebras. To recap, an object algebra consists of:

1. A set of objects;
2. A set of functions that transform any object in the set into another object in the set;
3. A set of functions that compose any two or more objects in the set into an object in the set.

An algebra isn;t some arbitrary collection of objects and functions, there has to be some kind of compatibility between them so that he transformation and composition functions operate on all of the objects in the set.

When composing objects with behaviour, some care must be taken that they can be composed, and composed in a way that preserves their meaning. In this section on composing metaobjects, we will present a strategy for building composeable metaobjects that plays nicely with prototypes.
