## Private Extension and Composition

There are two things we've ignored so far. Looking back at our introduction to [Metaobjects](#metaobjects), we discussed whether metaobjects had forwarding or delegation semantics. We also discussed whether metaobjects were open or closed for extension and we discussed whether the target for forwarding/delegation was early- or late-bound.

Our `encapsulate` function is *closed for extension*. Let's take another look at it:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function encapsulate (behaviour) {
  var safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__",
      definedMethods = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'function'),
      dependencies = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'undefined'),
      encapsulatedObject = {};

  function createContext (methodReceiver) {
    return partialProxy(methodReceiver, dependencies);
  }

  function getContext (methodReceiver) {
    var context = methodReceiver[safekeepingName];
    if (context == null) {
      context = createContext(methodReceiver);
      Object.defineProperty(methodReceiver, safekeepingName, {
        enumerable: false,
        writable: false,
        value: context
      });
    }
    return context;
  }

  definedMethods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    var methodBody = behaviour[methodName];

    encapsulatedObject[methodName] = function () {
      var context = getContext(this),
          result  = methodBody.apply(context, arguments);
      return (result === context) ? this : result;
    };
  });

  return encapsulatedObject;
}
~~~~~~~~

When we use `encapsulate` to create a metaobject, we associate each of the methods with a partial proxy for `this`:

![Songwriter](images/8/songwriter.png)

Once the metaobject has been created, there is (deliberately) no obvious way to access its partial proxy. For this reason, it is difficult to extend a metaobject created by encapsulate. If we try to replace an existing method, the new version will not have access to the proxy. For example, this ill-advised attempt to change the `songs` method to return an english string instead of an array:

~~~~~~~~
var Songwriter = encapsulate({
  initialize: function () {
    this._songs = [];
    return this;
  },
  addSong: function (name) {
    this._songs.push(name);
    return this;
  },
  songs: function () {
    return this._songs;
  }
});

function englishList (list) {
  var butLast = list.slice(0, list.length - 1),
      last = list[list.length - 1];
  return butLast.length > 0
         ? [butLast.join(', '), last].join(' and ')
         : last;
}

Songwriter.songs = function () {
  return englishList(this._songs);
}
~~~~~~~~

This won't work, the replacement method will not access the partial proxy, but instead its context will be `this` directly:

![Songwriter, extended](images/8/songwriter-extended.png)

This is not what we want! Open recursion (unrestricted access to `this`) re-introduces the coupling we worked so hard to avoid. And, the method won't work because `_songs` is a property of the partial proxy, not of the underlying `this`.

The same is true if we tried to add a new method. Encapsulated behaviours are *closed for modification* and *closed for extension*.

This is terrible if we like the free-wheeling "monkey-patching" style of metaprogramming popular in the Ruby community, but our code is actually doing its job properly by enfording clearly defined limits on how disparate pieces of code can influence each other's behaviour.

The one drawback of our code is that it lies: You *can* add or change a method, but it doesn't really work. It would be far better to catch these incorrect practices earlier.

We can prevent methods from being replaced using `Object.defineProperty` and prevent new methods from being added with `Object.preventExtensions`:

~~~~~~~~
var number = 0;

function encapsulate (behaviour) {
  var safekeepingName = "__" + ++number + "__",
      definedMethods = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'function'),
      dependencies = methodsOfType(behaviour, 'undefined'),
      encapsulatedObject = {};

  function createContext (methodReceiver) {
    return partialProxy(methodReceiver, dependencies);
  }

  function getContext (methodReceiver) {
    var context = methodReceiver[safekeepingName];
    if (context == null) {
      context = createContext(methodReceiver);
      Object.defineProperty(methodReceiver, safekeepingName, {
        enumerable: false,
        writable: false,
        value: context
      });
    }
    return context;
  }

  definedMethods.forEach(function (methodName) {
    var methodBody = behaviour[methodName];

    Object.defineProperty(encapsulatedObject, methodName, {
      writeable: false,
      value: function () {
        var context = getContext(this),
            result  = methodBody.apply(context, arguments);
        return (result === context) ? this : result;
      }
    });
  });

  return Object.preventExtensions(encapsulatedObject);
}
~~~~~~~~

Now if we try to modify `Songwriter`, it won't work. If we're in "strict mode," we get an error:

~~~~~~~~
!function () {
  "use strict"
  Songwriter.songs = function () {
    return englishList(this._songs)
  };
}();
  //=> TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'songs' of #<Object>
~~~~~~~~

This forces us to build new functionality with `composeBehaviours` and using the tools we've designed to control coupling.

### is there a middle ground?

`composeBehaviours` is designed very carefully to restrict coupling between metaobjects to public methods, and even then only to public methods that each metaobject declares it needs to use.

This is a very good thing when two metaobjects are *peers*, when they both provide their own functionality that is only loosely related, if at all. But the scheme breaks down when we are attempting to decorate or enhance the functionality of an existing behaviour.

Sometimes we deliberately *want* to reach in and work with the "hidden" implementation details of a behviour when writing an extended version of it. The trouble is, what we want today may hamper us tomorrow. Let's imagine we want an `EnglishSongsSongwriter` and have some hypothetical `decorateBehaviour` function.

Presuming that `decorateBehaviour` gives us access to `Songwriter`'s proxy, we could use our hypothetical function to write:

~~~~~~~~
function englishList (list) {
  var butLast = list.slice(0, list.length - 1),
      last = list[list.length - 1];
  return butLast.length > 0
         ? [butLast.join(', '), last].join(' and ')
         : last;
}

var EnglishSongsSongwriter = decorateBehaviour(
  EnglishSongsSongwriter, {
    songs: function () {
      return englishList(this._songs);
  }
});
~~~~~~~~


Of course, this presumes that our function gives our new `songs` method direct access to `Songwriter`'s proxy and therefore its private state (including `this._songs`). Which we've already established leads to tight coupling between `EnglishSongsSongwriter` and `Songwriter`.

That seems drastic. Is there a middle ground between complete access to all of `Songwriter`'s private state and only using `Songwriter`'s public methods?

### protected methods

*TODO* !!!!!
