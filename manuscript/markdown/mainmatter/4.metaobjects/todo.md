## To Do

### metaclasses and meta-metaobjects

### immediate, forward, and late-binding of metaobjects

### degenerate protocols

### eigenclasses, again

### prototypes vs. classes: metaobject-1s vs. metaobject-2s

### contracts and liskov equivalence

### metaobjects are not types, and types are not interfaces

### prototype chaining

### single inheritance

### mixins and multiple inheritance

### resolution: merge, override, and final

### method guards and contracts

### early and late method composition

### multiple dispatch and generic functions

### pattern matching protocols
