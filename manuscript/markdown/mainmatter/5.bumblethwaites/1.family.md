## The Bumblethwaite Family

Consider a programmer, Amanda Bumblethwaite.[^braithwaite] Amanda has several children, one of whom is Alex Bumblethwaite. Like many families, the Bumblethwaites have their own home in the *Apiary Meadows*, a suburban village. Although Alex is fairly independant, questions like "Can you come to a pajama party on Saturday night" are deferred to Amanda. Amanda taught each of her children how to write programs using [Squeak] and [Lego Mindstorms].

[^braithwaite]: Amanda was born "Amanda Braithwaite," but changed surnames to "Bumblethwaite" in protest against a certain author of programming books.

What can we say about the Bumblethwaites?

### constructors

First, we can say that *Amanda is Alex's constructor*. Amanda provides 50% of the blueprint for making Alex, and Amanda actually carried out the work of bringing Alex into existence. (We'll hand-wave furiously about David Bumblethwaite's role.)

### formal classes

Second, we can say that "Bumblethwaite" is a *formal class*. Amanda is a member of the Bumblethwaite class, and so is Alex. The formal class itself has no physical existence. Amanda has a physical existence, and there is an understanding that all of Amanda's children are necessarily Bumblethwaites, but the concept of "Bumblethwaite-ness" is abstract.

### expectations

Because Amanda teaches all of her children how to program, knowing that Alex is a Bumblethwaite, we expect Alex to know how to program. Knowing that the Bumblethwaite live in Apiary Meadows, and knowing that Alex is a Bumblethwaite, we expect that Alex lives in Apiary Meadows.

### delegation

Alex *delegates* a lot of behaviour to Amanda. Meaning, that there are many choices she makes by asking Amanda what to do, and Amanda makes the choice based on Alex's interests, in Alex's context.

### ad hoc sets

While it's true that all Bumblethwaites are programmers, the concept of "being a programmer" is different than the concept of "being a Bumblethwaite." Membership in the "set of all programmers" is determined empirically: If a person programs, they are a programmer. It is possible for someone who doesn't program to become a programmer.

Membership in "The Bumblethwaites" is a more formal affair. You must be born a Bumblethwaite, and issued a birth certificate with "Bumblethwaite" on it. Or you must marry into the Bumblethwaites, again getting a piece of paper attesting to your "Bumblethwaite-ness."

Where "Bumblethwaite" is a formal class, "Programmer" is an ad hoc set.

These five ideas--constructors, formal classes, expectations, delegation, and ad hoc sets--characterize most ideas in object-oriented programming. Each programming language provides tools for expressing these ideas, although the languages tend to use the same words in slightly different ways.

JavaScript provides objects, functions and prototypes. The `new` keyword allows functions to be used as constructors. Prototypes are used for delegating behaviour. Just as Alex delegates behaviour to Amanda *and* Amanda constructs Alex, it is normal in JavaScript that a function is paired with a prototype to produce, through composition, an entity that handles construction and delegation of behaviour.

"Classic" JavaScript does not have the notion of a class, but JavaScript programmers often refer to such compositions as classes. JavaScript provides the `instanceof` operator to test whether an object was created by such a composite function. `instanceof` is a leaky abstraction, but it works well enough for treating constructer functions as formal classes.
