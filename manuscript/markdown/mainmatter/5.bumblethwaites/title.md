# Interlude: At home with the Bumblethwaites {#bumblethwaites}

*Any discussion about programming with objects turns inevitably to programming with "classes" and to "inheritance." Some will even construct elaborate ontologies of domain objects, saying things like "ChequingAccount is-a BankAccount," and "SignatureAccount is-a ChequingAccount."*

*Every programming language provides its own own unique combination of features and concepts, yet there are some ideas common to all object-oriented programming that we can grasp and use as the basis for writing our own programs. Since "inheritance" is a metaphor, we'll explain these concepts using a metaphor. Specifically, we'll talk about a family.*
