## Formal Classes, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Sets

The distinction between "Bumblethwaite" and "Programmer" from our example above is a fundamental idea in object-oriented programming. Formal classes are a way of organizing knowledge about the domain and establishing expectations. By organizing constructors and prototypes in a certain way, we can set the expectation that all instances of "Bumblethwaite" can program.

Let's imagine that our definition of "is a programmer" is expressed as having a function called `writeFunction`:

    function isaProgrammer (candidate) {
      return typeof(candidate.writeFunction) === 'function';
    }

It's easy to imagine that "amanda is a programmer:"

    var amanda = {
      writeFunction: function (requirements) {
        var newFunction;
        // ... gimcrack code to convert formal requirements into a working function
        return newFunction;
      }
    };

    isaProgrammer(amanda)
      //=> true

We can say that "alex is a Bumblethwaite:"

    function Bumblethwaite () {}

    var alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    alex instanceof Bumblethwaite
      //=> true

We can say that every Bumblethwaite is created as a programmer:

    function Bumblethwaite () {
      this.writeFunction = function (requirements) {
        // ... better code to convert formal requirements into a working function
      }
    }

    var alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    isaProgrammer(alex)
      //=> true

Or even that the Bumblethwaites delegate their programming to Amanda:

    function Bumblethwaite () {}

    Bumblethwaite.prototype = amanda;

    alex = new Bumblethwaite();

    isaProgrammer(alex)
      //=> true

We are setting up the *expectation* that if `alex instanceof Bumblethwaite === true`, *then* `isaProgrammer(alex) === true`. Object-oriented programming is, at its heart, around organizing knowledge such that you can form and test such expectations.

### "duck typing"

A number of languages are built around having very high confidence in the expectations associated with classes.

Early-binding languages like OCaml carefully check programs so that if a function is expecting to work with a "Programmer" object, all other pieces of code interacting with that function pass programmer objects and nothing else.

Many (but not all) early-binding languages emphasize the use of formal-classes. Languages like Java are unable to formalize the idea that a "programmer" is any object with a `writeProgram` method, programs must formalize this notion using a class and/or interface that can then be associated with variables and/or parameters.

The compiler then checks all assignments to ensure that only values of the appropriate type are bound to each variable or parameter.

It is going to far to call such checking a "proof of program correctness," but without question such checking can reveal when a program is demonstrably *incorrect* in that it is not internally consistent.

Late-binding languages like JavaScript and Python do not provide this kind of checking, and there is no easy way to "declare" what a function or method expects. It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that a program is internally consistent.

While many early-binding languages are built around formal classes, most late-binding languages are really built around ad hoc sets. In JavaScript, when you write `amanda.writeProgram(specification)`, all that matters is that when this is evaluated, the name `amanda` must be bound to an object that directly or indirectly implements a `writeFunction` method.

The colloquial term for this is "duck typing," as in "If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." This phrase captures the ad hoc set way of thinking.
