## Well, Actually...

Both inheritance and mixins have their place for both our domain classes and the metaobjects that define them. However, if not designed with care, object-oriented code bases evolve over time to become brittle and coupled whether they're built with inheritance or mixins. Let's take another look at class mixins and see why.

In [Class Mixins](#class-mixins), we saw how we could build two mixins, `Fluentize` and `Singletonize`. Implementing these two semantics as mixins allows us to create classes that have neither semantic, fluent semantics, singleton prototype semantics, or both. This is far less brittle than trying to do the same thing by cramming both sets of functionality into every class (the "heavyweight base" approach) or trying to set up an artificial inheritance hierarchy.

This sounds great for classes of classes and for our domains as well: Build classes for domain objects, and write mixins for various bits of shared functionality. Close the book, we're done!

Alas, we're not done. The flexibility of mixins is an illusion, and by examining the hidden problem, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how to design object-oriented software.

### selfbindingization

In our next example, `Fluentize` overrides the `defineMethod` method, such that fluent classes use its implementation and not the implementation built into `MetaClass`. Likewise, `Singletonize` overrides the `create` method, such that singleton prototype classes use its implementation and not the implementation built into `MetaClass`.

These two mixins affect completely different methods, and furthermore the changes they make do not affect each other in any way. But this isn't always the case, consider this counter:

    var Counter = Class.create();

    Counter
      .defineMethod('initialize', function () { this._count = 0; })
      .defineMethod('increment', function () { ++this._count; })
      .defineMethod('count', function () { return this.count; });

    var c = Counter.create();

And we have some function written in continuation-passing-style:

    function log (message, callback) {
      console.log(message);
      return callback();
    }

Alas, we can't use our counter:

    log("doesn't work", c.increment);

The trouble is that the expression `c.increment` returns the body of the method, but when it is invoked using `callback()`, the original context of `c` has been lost. The usual solution is to write:

    log("works", c.increment.bind(c));

The `.bind` method binds the context permanently. Another solution is to write (or use a [function][_bind] to write):

[_bind]: http://underscorejs.org/#bind

    c.increment = c.increment.bind(c);

Then you can write:

    log("works without thinking about it", c.increment);

It seems like a lot of trouble to be writing this out everywhere, *especially* when the desired behaviour is nearly always that methods be bound. Let's write another mixin:

    function SelfBindingize (klass) {
      klass.defineMethod = function (name, body) {
        Object.defineProperty(this.prototype, name, {
          get: function () {
            return body.bind(this);
          }
        });
        return this;
      }
    }

    var SelfBindingCounter = Class.create();
    SelfBindingize(SelfBindingCounter);

    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('initialize', function () { this._count = 0; })
    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('increment', function () { return ++this._count; })
    SelfBindingCounter.defineMethod('count', function () { return this.count; });

    var cc = SelfBindingCounter.create();

    function log (message, callback) {
      console.log(message);
      return callback();
    }

    log("works without thinking about it", cc.increment);

Classes that mix `SelfBindingize` in are  self-binding. We've encapsulated the internal representation and implementation, and hidden it behind a method that we mix into the class.

### composition

As we might expect, `SelfBindingize` plays nicely with `Singletonize`, just as `Fluentize` did. But speaking of `Fluentize`, `Singletonize` does **not** play nicely with `Fluentize`. They both create new versions of `defineMethod`, and if you try to use both, only the last one executed will take effect.

The problem is that `SelfBindingize` and `Fluentize` don't *compose*. We can make up lots more similar examples too. In fact, metaprogramming tools generally *don't* compose when you write them individually. And this lesson is not restricted to "advanced" ideas like writing class mixins: Mixins in the problem domain have the same problem, they tend *not* to compose by default, and that makes using them a finicky and fragile process.

The na√Øve way to solve this problem is to write our mixins, and then when conflicts are discovered, rewrite them to play well together. This is not a bad strategy, in fact it might be considered the "optimistic" strategy. As long as we are aware of the possibility of conflicts and know to look for them when the code does not do what we expect, it is not unreasonable to try to avoid conflicts rather than investing in another layer of abstraction up front.

On the other hand, if we expect to be doing a lot of mixing in, it is a good investment to design around composition up front rather than deal with the uncertainty of not knowing when what appears to be a small change might lead to a lot of rewriting later on.

When dealing with semantics "in the large," such as when writing class mixins, there generally aren't a lot of "custom" semantics needed in one software application, and they generally come up early in the design and development process. Thus, many developers take the optimistic approach: They build classes and incorporate custom semantics as they go, resolving any conflicts where needed.

However, in the real of the problem domain, there are many more requirements for mixing functionality in, and requirements change more often. Thus, experienced programmers will sometimes build (or "borrow" from a library) infrastructure to make it easy to compose mixed-in functionality for domain objects.

For example, in the [Ruby on Rails] framework, there is extensive support for binding behaviour to controller methods and to model object lifecycles, and the library is carefully written so that you can bind more than one quantum of behaviour, and the bindings compose neatly without overwriting each others' effects.

This support is implemented with metaprogramming of the semantics of controller and model base classes. If we accept the notion that we are more likely to need to compose model behaviour than metaobject behaviour, one way forward is to use our tools for metaobject programming to implement a protocol for composing model behaviour.

Let's take a look at one way to make that happen.
