## Everything's a Value

As James Coglan pointed out, one of JavaScript's defining characteristics is that *everything is a value*. Everything can be stored in an array or as the property of an object. Everything can be passed to a function or method as a parameter. Everything can be returned from a method or parameter. You can use `===` and `!===` on everything.

Especially, some people note, functions. Functions are values. Functions can be passed as parameters. Functions can be returned from functions. An example, here's a simple array-backed stack with an `undo` function:[^partial]

[^partial]: We'll see in [Decoupling with Partial Proxies](#more-encapsulation) that it's a *partial proxy* for an array.

~~~~~~~~
var stack = {
  array: [],
  undo: null,
  push: function (value) {
    this.undo = function () {
      this.array.pop();
      this.undo = null;
    };
    return this.array.push(value);
  },
  pop: function () {
    var popped = this.array.pop();
    this.undo = function () {
      this.array.push(popped);
      this.undo = null;
    };
    return popped;
  },
  isEmpty: function () {
    return array.length === 0;
  }
};

stack.push('hello');
stack.push('there');
stack.undo();
stack.pop();
  //=> 'hello'
~~~~~~~~

We're treating the `undo` function like any other value and putting it in a property. We could stick functions into an array if we wanted:

~~~~~~~~
var stack = {
  array: [],
  undoStack: [],
  push: function (value) {
    this.undoStack.push(function () {
      this.array.pop();
    });
    return this.array.push(value);
  },
  pop: function () {
    var popped = this.array.pop();
    this.undoStack.push(function () {
      this.array.push(popped);
    });
    return popped;
  },
  isEmpty: function () {
    return array.length === 0;
  },
  undo: function () {
    this.undoStack.pop().call(this);
  }
};

stack.push('hello');
stack.push('there');
stack.push('javascript');
stack.undo();
stack.undo();
stack.pop();
  //=> 'hello'
~~~~~~~~

Functions-as-values is a powerful idea. And people often look at the idea of functions-as-values and think, "Oh, JavaScript is a functional programming language." No. JavaScript is an everything-is-a-value language. So instead of passing some boolean around and then writing some code saying "if true, do this, if false, do that," you just pass a function that does *this*, or you pass a function that does *that*.

Objects aren't something different. There is no tension between JavaScript the functional language and JavaScript the object-oriented language. When you see Javascript the everything-is-a-value language, you see that objects are a natural growth of the idea that everything can be made into an explicit value, even things with behaviour.

One example we'll discuss later concerns [state machines](#state-machines). We *could* implement a cell in [Conway's Game of Life][gol] using `if` statements and a boolean property to determine whether the cell was alive or dead:

~~~~~~~~
var Universe = {
  // ...
  numberOfNeighbours: function (location) {
    // ...
  }
};

var Cell = {
  numberOfNeighbours: function () {
    return Universe.numberOfNeighbours(this.location);
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    if (this.alive) {
      return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3);
    }
    else {
      return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 2 || this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3);
    }
  }
};

var someCell = extend({
  alive: true,
  location: {x: -15, y: 12}
}, Cell);
~~~~~~~~

You could say that the "state" of the cell is the boolean value `true` for alive or `false` for dead. But that isn't really making the state a value. The "state" in a state machine includes the behaviour of the object that depends on the state.

In the design above, the true state of the object is *implicit* in the object's behaviour, but it isn't a value. Here's a design where we make the state a value:

~~~~~~~~
var Alive = {
  alive: function () {
    return true;
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3);
  }
};

var Dead = {
  alive: function () {
    return false;
  },
  stateInNextGeneration: function () {
    return (this.numberOfNeighbours() === 2 || this.numberOfNeighbours() === 3);
  }
};

var Cell = {
  numberOfNeighbours: function () {
    return thisGame.numberOfNeighbours(this.location);
  }
}

delegateToOwn(Cell, 'state', ['alive', 'stateInNextGeneration']);

var someCell = extend({
  state: Alive,
  location: {x: -15, y: 12}
}, Cell);
~~~~~~~~

`delegateToOwn` is a function we'll explain in [Later Binding](#later-binding). It delegates the methods `alive` and `stateInNextGeneration` to whatever object is the value of a `Cell`'s `state` property.

So when we write `someCell.state = Alive`, then the `Alive` object will handle `someCell.alive` and `someCell.stateInNextGeneration`. And when we write `someCell.state = Dead`, then the `Dead` object will handle `someCell.alive` and `someCell.stateInNextGeneration`.

Now we've taken the implicit states of being alive or dead and transformed them into the first-class values `Alive` and `Dead`. Not a boolean that is used implicitly in some other code, but the actual "stuff that matters about aliveness and deadness."

This is not different than the example of passing functions around: They're both the same thing, taking something would be *implicit* in another design and/or another language, and making it *explicit*, making it a value. And making the whole thing a value, not just a boolean or a string, the complete entity.
